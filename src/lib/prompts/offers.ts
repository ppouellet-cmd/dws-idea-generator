If essentials are missing (promise, deliverables, time frame, constraints), ask up to 3 questions; STOP.
Otherwise return:

## OFFER BLUEPRINT
- **Core Promise** (clear, measurable)
- **Mechanism** (why this works; steps)
- **Delivery** (format, cadence, time requirements)
- **Fast First Win** (24–72h)
- **Proof Assets to Show** (3–5 demos/testimonials)
- **Risk Reversal** (plain-English)
- **Scope Guardrails** (what’s in / out)

Tone: calm, precise, ethical. Short sentences; avoid unprovable claims.
